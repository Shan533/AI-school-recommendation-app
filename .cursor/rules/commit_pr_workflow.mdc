# Git Workflow & PR Standards

This rule defines the complete workflow for branch management, commits, and pull requests using Graphite for stacked PRs.

## 🌿 Branch Management

### Branch Naming Convention
```
<type>: <brief-description> #<issue-number>
```

**Examples:**
- `feat: add user authentication system #123`
- `fix: resolve mobile navigation overflow #156`
- `refactor: extract database helpers #189`
- `docs: update API documentation #234`

### Workflow Steps
1. **Create Feature Branch**: Start from main branch
2. **Use Graphite**: For stacked PRs and better branch management
3. **Regular Commits**: Make atomic commits with clear messages
4. **Pre-Commit Validation**: Run all checks before committing (see below)
5. **Push & Create PR**: After feature completion

## ✅ Pre-Commit Validation Checklist

**MANDATORY: Run these commands before every commit:**

### 🧪 Testing
```bash
# Run all tests - MUST pass 100%
npm test

### 🔍 Code Quality
```bash
# Check for linting errors - MUST pass
npm run lint

# Check TypeScript compilation - MUST pass
npm run build

# Verify no runtime errors
npm run start  # Test locally if significant changes
```

### 📊 Coverage & Performance
```bash
# Check test coverage (aim for >90%)
npm test -- --coverage

# Verify bundle size (check for significant increases)
npm run build && du -sh .next/static/
```

### 🔧 Pre-Commit Command Sequence
```bash
# Complete validation sequence
npm test && npm run lint && npm run build
```

**⚠️ COMMIT ONLY IF ALL CHECKS PASS**

## 📝 Commit Message Standards

### Format
```
<type>(optional-scope): <description> #<issue-number>
```

### Commit Types
- **feat**: New feature implementation
- **fix**: Bug fixes
- **refactor**: Code restructuring without functionality changes
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks (dependencies, build, etc.)
- **docs**: Documentation updates
- **test**: Test additions or modifications
- **style**: Code formatting, linting fixes

### Examples
```bash
feat(auth): add email input validation #145
fix(ui): prevent token expiration crash #151
refactor(search): extract ranking algorithm to utils #142
chore: update Next.js to version 15.4.6 #159
docs(readme): add environment setup guide #168
test(admin): add review management test suite #173
```

## 🎯 Pull Request Standards

### PR Title Format
```
<type>(scope): <brief-description> #<issue-number>
```

**Examples:**
- `feat(auth): add email verification flow #234`
- `fix(ui): resolve mobile navigation overflow #189`
- `refactor(api): extract user validation logic #156`
