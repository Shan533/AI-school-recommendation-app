# AI Recommendations Testing Guide

*This guide will be implemented in Phase 3 when the AI recommendation engine is developed.*

## Overview

This guide will cover testing the AI recommendation system functionality, including:
- User preference collection
- Recommendation algorithm testing
- Personalized school/program suggestions
- Recommendation accuracy and relevance
- A/B testing for recommendation improvements

## Planned Testing Areas

### User Preference Testing
- [ ] Preference collection forms
- [ ] Preference storage and retrieval
- [ ] Preference updates and modifications
- [ ] Preference privacy and data handling
- [ ] Preference-based filtering

### Recommendation Algorithm Testing
- [ ] Algorithm accuracy testing
- [ ] Recommendation relevance scoring
- [ ] Diversity in recommendations
- [ ] Cold start problem handling
- [ ] Algorithm performance optimization

### Recommendation Display Testing
- [ ] Recommendation cards and lists
- [ ] Recommendation explanations
- [ ] Recommendation filtering options
- [ ] Recommendation refresh functionality
- [ ] Recommendation feedback collection

### A/B Testing Framework
- [ ] Recommendation algorithm variants
- [ ] UI/UX variations for recommendations
- [ ] Performance metrics collection
- [ ] Statistical significance testing
- [ ] Continuous improvement monitoring

## Implementation Status

- [ ] **Phase 3 Planning**: AI recommendation system design
- [ ] **Algorithm Development**: Recommendation engine implementation
