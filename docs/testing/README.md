## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Unit Test Implementation
1. **Choose Testing Tool**: 
   - **Jest**: Pure functions (`validation.ts`, `utils.ts`) ✅ 100% coverage
   - **Vitest**: Server Components (`helpers.ts`) ✅ 100% coverage
2. **Review Implementation Plan**: Start with [Testing Implementation Plan](./testing-implementation-plan.md) to understand priorities
3. **Check Current Status**: 116 tests passing (65 Jest + 51 Vitest)
4. **Run Coverage**: `npm run test:coverage` (Jest) or `npm run test:vitest:coverage` (Vitest)

### For Manual Testing
1. **Start with Core Setup**: Begin with [Core Setup Testing](./core-setup-testing.md) to verify your environment
2. **Test Admin Features**: Use [Admin CRUD Testing](./admin-crud-testing.md) to test data management
3. **Verify Public Pages**: Use [Public Pages Testing](./public-pages-testing.md) to test user experience
4. **Test Bulk Operations**: Use [CSV Upload Testing](./csv-upload-testing.md) to test data import

## 📊 Testing Workflow

### Before Each Release
1. Run all unit tests: `npm test && npm run test:vitest`
2. Test all CRUD operations
3. Verify CSV upload functionality
4. Test public pages on multiple devices
5. Check error handling scenarios
6. Validate mobile responsiveness

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test && npm run test:vitest

# Coverage reports
npm run test:coverage && npm run test:vitest:coverage

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch          # Jest
npm run test:vitest:watch   # Vitest
```

### Continuous Testing
- Monitor for JavaScript console errors
- Test new features as they're implemented
- Update testing guides for new functionality
- Document any new edge cases discovered

## 🎯 Testing Priorities

### High Priority (Critical Path)
1. Admin authentication and authorization
2. Schools and programs CRUD operations
3. CSV upload functionality
4. Public page data display
5. Basic error handling

### Medium Priority (User Experience)
1. Mobile responsiveness
2. Form validation
3. Loading states
4. User feedback messages
5. Navigation consistency

### Low Priority (Enhancement)
1. Performance optimization
2. Advanced error handling
3. Accessibility improvements
4. Cross-browser compatibility
5. Advanced UI features

## 📝 Documentation Standards

### Test Case Format
Each test case should include:
- **Test Name**: Clear, descriptive name
- **Prerequisites**: What needs to be set up
- **Steps**: Numbered, clear instructions
- **Expected Result**: What should happen
- **Actual Result**: What actually happened (for failed tests)

### Bug Reporting
When reporting bugs, include:
- **Environment**: Browser, OS, device
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Clear reproduction steps
- **Expected vs Actual**: What should vs what does happen
- **Console Errors**: Any JavaScript errors
- **Screenshots**: Visual evidence if applicable

## 🔄 Maintenance

### Updating Testing Guides
- Update guides when new features are implemented
- Add new test cases for edge cases discovered
- Remove obsolete test cases
- Update links and references as needed

### Version Control
- Keep testing guides in sync with application versions
- Tag testing guides with application release versions
- Maintain changelog for testing guide updates
