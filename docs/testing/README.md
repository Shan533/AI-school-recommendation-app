## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Start with Core Setup**: Begin with [Core Setup Testing](./core-setup-testing.md) to verify your environment
2. **Test Admin Features**: Use [Admin CRUD Testing](./admin-crud-testing.md) to test data management
3. **Verify Public Pages**: Use [Public Pages Testing](./public-pages-testing.md) to test user experience
4. **Test Bulk Operations**: Use [CSV Upload Testing](./csv-upload-testing.md) to test data import

## 📊 Testing Workflow

### Before Each Release
1. Run all core setup tests
2. Test all CRUD operations
3. Verify CSV upload functionality
4. Test public pages on multiple devices
5. Check error handling scenarios
6. Validate mobile responsiveness

### Continuous Testing
- Monitor for JavaScript console errors
- Test new features as they're implemented
- Update testing guides for new functionality
- Document any new edge cases discovered

## 🎯 Testing Priorities

### High Priority (Critical Path)
1. Admin authentication and authorization
2. Schools and programs CRUD operations
3. CSV upload functionality
4. Public page data display
5. Basic error handling

### Medium Priority (User Experience)
1. Mobile responsiveness
2. Form validation
