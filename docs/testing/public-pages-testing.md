## Troubleshooting

### Common Public Page Issues

**Issue: "Page not found" errors**
- **Solution**: Check that schools/programs exist in database
- **Check**: Verify URL structure and routing

**Issue: "Slow page loading"**
- **Solution**: Check database queries and optimize if needed
- **Check**: Verify image sizes and loading strategies

**Issue: "Broken layout on mobile"**
- **Solution**: Check responsive CSS and viewport settings
- **Check**: Test on actual mobile devices

**Issue: "Missing data"**
- **Solution**: Verify data exists in database
- **Check**: Check API endpoints and data fetching logic

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

After completing public pages testing:
1. Test **[Admin CRUD Operations](./admin-crud-testing.md)** to add more test data
2. Verify **[CSV Upload Functionality](./csv-upload-testing.md)** works with public display
3. Check **[Error Handling Scenarios](./error-handling-testing.md)**
