# Testing Plan: AI School Recommend App

This is the main testing documentation for the AI School Recommend App. It provides an overview of all testing activities and links to specific testing guides.

## 📋 Testing Overview

The testing strategy is organized by feature areas and development phases:

### Phase 1 Testing (Current)
- **Core Setup Testing** - Environment, database, authentication
- **Admin CRUD Operations** - Schools and programs management
- **CSV Upload Testing** - Bulk data import functionality
- **Public Pages Testing** - User-facing school and program browsing
- **Error Handling Testing** - Edge cases and error scenarios

### Future Phase Testing
- **User Reviews & Ratings** - Review system functionality
- **Collections & Favorites** - User collection management
- **AI Recommendations** - Recommendation algorithm testing
- **Performance Testing** - Load testing and optimization
- **Security Testing** - Authentication and authorization
- **Mobile Testing** - Cross-device compatibility

## 🚀 Quick Start Testing

### Prerequisites
1. **Database Setup**: Run the SQL migration script in your Supabase SQL editor
2. **Environment Variables**: Create `.env.local` with your Supabase credentials
3. **Start Development Server**: `npm run dev`

### Essential Tests (Must Pass)
- [ ] **Core Setup**: Environment and database connection
- [ ] **Admin Authentication**: Login and admin access
- [ ] **Schools CRUD**: Create, read, update, delete schools
- [ ] **Programs CRUD**: Create, read, update, delete programs
- [ ] **CSV Upload**: Bulk data import functionality
- [ ] **Public Pages**: School and program browsing
- [ ] **User Reviews**: Review submission, editing, deletion
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and fallbacks

## 📊 Testing Metrics

### Success Criteria
- ✅ All core functionality works without errors
- ✅ Admin can manage schools and programs
- ✅ CSV upload processes data correctly
- ✅ Public pages display data properly
- ✅ User reviews system fully functional
- ✅ Authentication and authorization work
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness functions
- ✅ Error handling provides user feedback

### Performance Targets
- Page load times < 2 seconds
- API response times < 500ms
- Mobile-friendly on all screen sizes
- No JavaScript console errors

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Authentication Issues
- **Problem**: Admin pages redirect to login
- **Solution**: Ensure user has `is_admin: true` in profiles table

### Database Issues
- **Problem**: "Supabase client could not be created"
- **Solution**: Check `.env.local` file and restart dev server

### CSV Upload Issues
- **Problem**: Upload fails with errors
- **Solution**: Verify CSV format and check network tab for API errors

## 🔄 Testing Workflow

### Before Each Release
1. Run all core setup tests
2. Test all CRUD operations
3. Verify CSV upload functionality
4. Test public pages on multiple devices
5. Check error handling scenarios
6. Validate mobile responsiveness

### Continuous Testing
- Monitor for JavaScript console errors
- Test new features as they're implemented
- Update testing guides for new functionality
- Document any new edge cases discovered

## 📝 Testing Documentation Standards

### Test Case Format
Each test case should include:
- **Test Name**: Clear, descriptive name
- **Prerequisites**: What needs to be set up
- **Steps**: Numbered, clear instructions
- **Expected Result**: What should happen
- **Actual Result**: What actually happened (for failed tests)

### Bug Reporting
When reporting bugs, include:
- **Environment**: Browser, OS, device
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Clear reproduction steps
- **Expected vs Actual**: What should vs what does happen
- **Console Errors**: Any JavaScript errors
- **Screenshots**: Visual evidence if applicable
