# Admin Reviews Management Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide covers testing the admin review management functionality, which allows administrators to view and delete user reviews for moderation purposes.

## Features Implemented

- **Admin Dashboard Integration**: Reviews Management card added to admin dashboard
- **Reviews List View**: Display all reviews (schools and programs) with search functionality
- **Review Statistics**: Basic stats showing total reviews, average rating, and breakdown by type
- **Admin Delete**: Administrators can delete any review with confirmation
- **Search Functionality**: Filter reviews by comment content, user name, or school/program name
- **API Endpoint**: REST API for programmatic review deletion

## Testing Checklist

### Access Control
- [ ] **Admin Authentication**: Only admin users can access `/admin/reviews`
- [ ] **Non-admin Redirect**: Regular users are redirected away from admin pages
- [ ] **Login Required**: Unauthenticated users are redirected to login

### Reviews Display
- [ ] **All Reviews Listed**: Both school and program reviews appear in the list
- [ ] **Review Details**: Each review shows rating, comment, user name, item name, date
- [ ] **Review Type Badge**: Clear indication of whether it's a school or program review
- [ ] **Empty State**: Appropriate message when no reviews exist
- [ ] **Statistics Cards**: Correct counts and average rating calculations

### Search Functionality
- [ ] **Search by Comment**: Find reviews containing specific text in comments
- [ ] **Search by User**: Find reviews by specific user names
- [ ] **Search by School/Program**: Find reviews for specific schools or programs
- [ ] **Clear Search**: Ability to clear search and return to full list
- [ ] **No Results**: Appropriate message when search returns no results

### Delete Functionality
- [ ] **Delete Confirmation**: Confirmation dialog appears before deletion
- [ ] **Successful Deletion**: Review is removed from list after deletion
- [ ] **Page Refresh**: List updates to show current state after deletion
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of delete failures

### UI/UX
- [ ] **Mobile Responsive**: Interface works well on mobile devices
- [ ] **Loading States**: Appropriate feedback during operations
- [ ] **Navigation**: Easy navigation back to admin dashboard
- [ ] **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear organization and readability

## Test Scenarios

### Basic Admin Flow
1. Login as admin user
2. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
3. Click "Manage Reviews" 
4. Verify all reviews are displayed
5. Test search functionality
6. Delete a review and confirm it's removed

### Edge Cases
- [ ] **Very Long Comments**: Reviews with extensive text display properly
- [ ] **Special Characters**: Reviews with emojis and unicode display correctly
- [ ] **Multiple Deletions**: Deleting multiple reviews in sequence
- [ ] **Concurrent Access**: Multiple admins accessing the system simultaneously

### Error Scenarios
- [ ] **Network Errors**: Graceful handling of connection issues
- [ ] **Permission Errors**: Proper error messages for unauthorized access
- [ ] **Invalid Review IDs**: Handling of non-existent review deletion attempts

## Database Verification

After testing, verify in the database:
- Deleted reviews are completely removed from `school_reviews` and `program_reviews` tables
- RLS policies allow admin access for update and delete operations
- No orphaned data or broken relationships

## Performance Considerations

- [ ] **Large Review Lists**: Performance with 100+ reviews
- [ ] **Search Performance**: Fast search results even with many reviews
- [ ] **Page Load Time**: Reasonable load times for the reviews management page

## Security Testing

- [ ] **RLS Enforcement**: Row Level Security policies work correctly
- [ ] **Admin-only Access**: Non-admins cannot access admin endpoints
- [ ] **SQL Injection**: Search inputs are properly sanitized
- [ ] **CSRF Protection**: Forms include proper CSRF protection
