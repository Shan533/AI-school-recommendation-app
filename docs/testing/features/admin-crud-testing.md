# Admin CRUD Testing Guide

This guide helps you test the complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for schools and programs management in the admin interface.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure your Next.js development server is running: `npm run dev`
2. You must be logged in as an admin user
3. Navigate to the admin dashboard: `http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard`

## Testing Schools CRUD Operations

### Navigate to Schools Management
- Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin/schools`
- You should see the "Schools Management" page with:
  - Add New School form at the top
  - Existing Schools table at the bottom

### Test CREATE (Add New School)
1. Fill out the "Add New School" form with test data:
   - School Name: "Test University" (required)
   - Abbreviation: "TU"
   - Type: "University" 
   - Country: "USA"
   - Location: "Test City, CA"
   - Year Founded: 2000
   - QS Ranking: 100
   - Website URL: "https://test-university.edu"
2. Click "Add School"
3. âœ… Verify the school appears in the table below

### Test READ (View Schools)
- [ ] **View All Schools**: Verify the table displays all schools
- [ ] **School Details**: Check that all school information is displayed correctly

5. âœ… Verify the program disappears from the table immediately
6. âœ… Check that the dialog closes automatically
7. âœ… Verify associated requirements are also deleted (no orphaned data)

## Advanced CRUD Testing

### Numerical Range Validation Testing

#### Frontend Input Controls Testing

**Test IELTS Score Field:**
1. Try entering 10.0 (should be capped at 9.0)
2. Try entering -1 (should be capped at 0)
3. Try entering 6.3 (should snap to 6.5 due to 0.5 step)

**Test Duration Field:**
1. Try entering 0.3 (should be capped at 0.5)
2. Try entering 10 (should be capped at 8.0)

**Test Credits Field:**
1. Try entering 0 (should be capped at 1)
2. Try entering 300 (should be capped at 200)

#### Backend API Validation Testing

**Send invalid data via browser dev tools:**
```javascript
// Test in browser console on admin/programs page
fetch('/api/admin/programs/1', {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'Test Program',
    degree: 'Master',
    school_id: 1,
    ielts_score: 15, // Invalid: over 9.0
    duration_years: 0.1, // Invalid: under 0.5
    credits: 300 // Invalid: over 200
  })
})
```

**Expected Results:**
- Should return 400 error with specific validation messages
- Example: "IELTS Score must be between 0 and 9, Duration must be between 0.5 and 8, Credits must be between 1 and 200"

### Validated Numerical Ranges

- **IELTS Score**: 0.0 - 9.0 (step: 0.5)
- **TOEFL Score**: 0 - 120 (step: 1)
- **GRE Score**: 260 - 340 (step: 1)
- **GPA**: 0.00 - 4.00 (step: 0.01)
- **Duration**: 0.5 - 8.0 years (step: 0.5)
- **Credits**: 1 - 200 (step: 1)
- **Total Tuition**: â‰¥ 0 (step: 100, no upper limit)
- **Application Fee**: â‰¥ 0 (step: 1, no upper limit)
- **Letters of Recommendation**: 0 - 10 (step: 1)
- **Year Founded**: 1000 - 2025 (step: 1)
- **QS Ranking**: 1 - 2000 (step: 1)

## Error Scenarios to Test

### School Deletion with Existing Programs
1. Create a school and a program associated with it
2. Try to delete the school that has programs
3. âœ… Should show error: "Cannot delete school with existing programs"
4. Delete or reassign the program first, then try deleting the school again
5. âœ… Should succeed after programs are removed

### Invalid Data Handling
1. Try editing a school/program with empty required fields
2. âœ… Should show appropriate error messages
3. Try entering invalid data (e.g., negative numbers for rankings)
4. âœ… Should handle gracefully

### Network Error Handling
1. Disconnect internet or stop the server
2. Try to edit or delete items
3. âœ… Should show error messages like "Failed to update/delete"
4. âœ… UI should not break or show loading state indefinitely

## API Endpoint Testing (Optional)

You can also test the API endpoints directly using tools like Postman or curl:

### Schools API
- GET `/api/admin/schools/[id]` - Get single school
- PUT `/api/admin/schools/[id]` - Update school
- DELETE `/api/admin/schools/[id]` - Delete school

### Programs API
- GET `/api/admin/programs/[id]` - Get single program with requirements
- PUT `/api/admin/programs/[id]` - Update program and requirements
- DELETE `/api/admin/programs/[id]` - Delete program and requirements

### Example curl commands:
```bash
# Get a school (replace {id} with actual ID)
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:3000/api/admin/schools/{id}

# Update a school
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Updated School","location":"New Location"}' \
  http://localhost:3000/api/admin/schools/{id}

# Delete a school
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/admin/schools/{id}
```

## Success Criteria

All tests should pass with:
- âœ… No JavaScript errors in browser console
- âœ… Smooth UI interactions with proper loading states
- âœ… Data persistence across page refreshes
- âœ… Proper error handling and user feedback
- âœ… Responsive design works on mobile/desktop
- âœ… All numerical validations work correctly
- âœ… Foreign key constraints are enforced

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Authentication errors**: Ensure you're logged in as an admin
2. **Network errors**: Check that the dev server is running
3. **Data not updating**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. **UI issues**: Try refreshing the page or clearing browser cache
5. **Schema errors**: Fixed multiple issues:
   - The `updated_at` column issue - API endpoints no longer try to update non-existent columns
   - The "Cannot coerce to single JSON object" error when checking for existing requirements
   - The "Program not found or update failed" error - RLS policy issue resolved by using admin client
   - **RLS Policy Issue**: Update operations now use admin client to bypass Row Level Security policies

## Implementation Summary

### âœ… What's Been Implemented:
- Dynamic API routes for individual schools and programs
- PUT endpoints for updating schools and programs
- DELETE endpoints with proper validation and cascade handling
- Client-side React components with edit/delete functionality
- Modal dialogs for editing with pre-filled forms
- Confirmation dialogs for deletion

- Comprehensive numerical validation

### ðŸ”§ Technical Details:
- Server-side validation and authorization

- Foreign key constraint validation (can't delete school with programs)
- JSON parsing for complex fields (add-ons)
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
