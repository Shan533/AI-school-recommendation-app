# Implementation Plan: AI School Recommend App

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for building the AI School Recommend App, from initial setup to final deployment and testing.

### 1. Development Roadmap (Phased Approach)

We will follow a phased approach to build the application, ensuring that we deliver a functional core product quickly and iterate with new features.

#### Phase 1: Core Functionality & Backend Setup

*   **Objective**: Establish the project foundation and implement essential features.
*   **Tasks**:
    1.  **Project Setup**: Initialize Next.js project, configure Tailwind CSS, and set up the Supabase backend.
    2.  **Database Schema**: Implement the full database schema in Supabase as defined in the design document.
    3.  **User Authentication**: Implement user registration and login flows.
    4.  **Admin CRUD**: Build the admin dashboard for manually adding, updating, and deleting schools and programs.
    5.  **Admin CSV Upload**: Implement CSV bulk upload functionality for schools and programs within the admin dashboard.
    6.  **Public Viewing**: Create public-facing pages for users to view lists of schools and programs, as well as their detailed pages.

#### Phase 2: User Engagement Features

*   **Objective**: Build features that allow users to interact with the platform.
*   **Tasks**:
    1.  **Reviews and Ratings**: Implement the ability for authenticated users to rate and review both schools and programs.
    2.  **User Profile & My Reviews**: Create a user profile page where users can see and manage their own reviews.
    3.  **Dual Ranking System**: Display both official and user-generated rankings on school pages.

#### Phase 3: Personalization & AI

*   **Objective**: Introduce advanced personalization and AI-driven features.
*   **Tasks**:
    1.  **Collections**: Implement the "like/save" functionality for schools and the ability to manage collections.
    2.  **Recommendation Engine (Filtering)**: Build the filtering logic based on user preferences.
    3.  **AI-Powered Explanations**: Integrate a lightweight AI model (e.g., using Vercel AI SDK with a provider like OpenAI or Groq) to generate recommendation reasons.

### 2. Frontend Strategy

*   **Mobile-First, Responsive Design**: We will adopt a mobile-first approach. All components and layouts will be designed for small screens first and then scaled up to larger viewport sizes using Tailwind CSS's responsive utility classes (e.g., `md:`, `lg:`). This ensures a great user experience on all devices.
*   **Component-Based Architecture**: We will leverage Next.js and React to build a library of reusable, modular components (e.g., buttons, cards, forms) located in the `components/` directory. We will use `shadcn/ui` to accelerate UI development with its accessible and composable components.
*   **State Management**: For global state, we will use React Context or a lightweight library like Zustand if needed. For server state and data fetching, we will use `SWR` or React Query in combination with `fetch` or a Supabase client.

### 3. Testing Plan

Testing will be integrated throughout the development process to ensure quality and reliability.

*   **Unit Testing**: Use Jest and React Testing Library to test individual components and utility functions.
*   **Integration Testing**: Test how different parts of the application work together, such as the flow from user login to submitting a review.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**: Use a framework like Cypress or Playwright to automate user flows and test the application from the user's perspective.
*   **Manual Testing**: Conduct manual testing before each release to catch any issues not covered by automated tests.

### 4. Performance Optimization Plan

Performance will be a key consideration, addressed after the core features are implemented and tested.

*   **Image Optimization**: Use the Next.js `<Image>` component to automatically optimize images.
*   **Code Splitting**: Leverage Next.js's automatic code splitting to ensure only necessary JavaScript is loaded for each page.
*   **Lazy Loading**: Lazy load components and assets that are not immediately needed.
*   **Database Query Optimization**: Analyze and optimize slow-running Supabase queries.
*   **Caching**: Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.
*   **Monitoring**: Use Vercel Analytics and other monitoring tools to track performance metrics and identify bottlenecks post-deployment.
