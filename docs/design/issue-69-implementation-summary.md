  - [ ] Add career paths selection
  - [ ] Update form validation
  - [ ] Update TypeScript interfaces

- [ ] **Admin Category Management** (New component)
  - [ ] Create category CRUD interface
  - [ ] Add category management page
  - [ ] Support abbreviation and career paths editing

- [ ] **CSV Upload Updates** (`src/app/admin/csv-upload/page.tsx`)
  - [ ] Add category mapping for CSV import
  - [ ] Add difficulty level mapping
  - [ ] Update CSV template with new fields
  - [ ] Update validation for new fields

#### Phase 2: API Updates
- [ ] **Program API** (`src/app/api/admin/programs/route.ts`)
  - [ ] Update create/update endpoints for new fields
  - [ ] Add category relationship handling
  - [ ] Update validation schemas

- [ ] **Category API** (New endpoints)
  - [ ] `GET /api/admin/categories` - List categories
  - [ ] `POST /api/admin/categories` - Create category
  - [ ] `PUT /api/admin/categories/[id]` - Update category
  - [ ] `DELETE /api/admin/categories/[id]` - Delete category

#### Phase 3: Public UI Updates (Future)
- [ ] **Program Cards** - Display categories and difficulty
- [ ] **Search & Filtering** - Category and difficulty filters
- [ ] **Program Detail Pages** - Show full category information

### 3. Testing

## üîç Key Design Decisions

### 1. Gamified Difficulty Scale
- Used SSR, SR, R, N scale similar to gacha games
- Provides intuitive understanding of competitiveness
- Easy to extend with more levels if needed

### 2. Many-to-Many Categories
- Programs can have multiple categories
- One primary category for main classification
- Flexible for complex program classifications

### 3. Flexible Ranking System
- Support for multiple ranking sources
- Year-based data for historical tracking
- Category-specific rankings (e.g., CS rankings vs overall)

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- Kept existing QS ranking field
- Migrated existing data to new system
- Gradual transition approach

## üìä Expected Impact

### User Experience
- Better program discovery through categories
- Clear understanding of program difficulty
- More comprehensive ranking information
- Enhanced search and filtering

### Admin Experience
- Better program classification
- Easier data management
- More comprehensive analytics
- Improved data quality

### Technical Benefits
- More flexible data model
- Better search capabilities
- Improved analytics potential
- Easier to extend in future

## üö® Risks & Mitigation

### Data Migration Risks
- **Risk**: Data loss during migration
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive backup and testing

### Performance Risks
- **Risk**: Slower queries with new relationships
- **Mitigation**: Proper indexing and query optimization

### UI Complexity
- **Risk**: More complex forms and interfaces
- **Mitigation**: Gradual rollout and user testing

## üìà Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- All existing functionality preserved
- New features working correctly
- Performance maintained or improved
- Test coverage maintained

### User Metrics
- Improved program discovery
- Better user engagement
- Increased search usage
- Positive user feedback

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues arise, we can:
1. Remove new columns from programs table
2. Drop new tables
3. Restore original functionality
4. Update frontend to remove new features

The migration is designed to be reversible with minimal data loss.
