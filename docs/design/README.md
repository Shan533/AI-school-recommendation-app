## 🤝 Contributing to Design

When adding new features or making architectural changes:

1. **Document First**: Update relevant design documents before implementation
2. **Consistency Check**: Ensure alignment with existing design principles
3. **Review Process**: Get design approval before major architectural changes
4. **Update Index**: Add new design documents to this README
