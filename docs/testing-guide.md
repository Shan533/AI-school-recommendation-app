- [‚ùå] **Delete School**: Click "Delete" on a school, confirm the deletion, and verify the school is removed from the table.

#### Programs Management (`/admin/programs`):
- [ ] **Add Program**: Create a test program:
  ```
  Name: Master of Science in Computer Science
  Initial: MSCS
  School: (select from dropdown)
  Degree: MS
  Duration: 24 months
  Currency: USD
  Tuition: 50000
  STEM: Yes
  Description: Advanced computer science program...
  ```
- [‚úÖ] **View Program**: Verify program appears in table with school info
- [‚úÖ] **Add Multiple Programs**: Create programs for different schools

- [‚ùå] **Delete Program**: Click "Delete" on a program, confirm the deletion, and verify the program is removed from the table.

### 5. CSV Upload Testing (`/admin/csv-upload`)

#### Test Schools CSV:
Create a CSV file named `test-schools.csv`:
```csv
name,initial,type,country,location,year_founded,qs_ranking,website_url
MIT,MIT,University,United States,"Cambridge, MA",1861,1,https://mit.edu
Harvard University,HU,University,United States,"Cambridge, MA",1636,3,https://harvard.edu
```
- [‚úÖ] **Upload Schools**: Test the schools CSV upload
- [‚úÖ] **Verify Results**: Check success/error messages
- [‚úÖ] **Check Database**: Verify schools were added

#### Test Programs CSV:
1. **Get School IDs**: From Supabase dashboard, copy school IDs
2. Create `test-programs.csv`:
```csv
name,initial,school_id,degree,duration_months,currency,total_tuition,is_stem,description
Computer Science,CS,school-id-here,MS,24,USD,60000,true,Advanced CS program
Business Administration,MBA,school-id-here,MBA,24,USD,70000,false,Business leadership program
```
- [‚úÖ] **Upload Programs**: Test the programs CSV upload
- [‚úÖ] **Verify Results**: Check success/error messages

### 6. Public Pages Testing

#### Schools Public View:
- [‚úÖ] **Schools List** (`/schools`): Should show all schools with cards
- [‚úÖ] **School Details** (`/schools/[id]`): Click on a school, verify:
  - School information displays correctly
  - Associated programs are listed
  - External links work
  - Navigation works

#### Programs Public View:
- [‚úÖ] **Programs List** (`/programs`): Should show all programs with school info
- [‚úÖ] **Program Details** (`/programs/[id]`): Click on a program, verify:
  - Program information displays correctly
  - School information is shown
  - Links to school page work
  - External links work

### 7. Error Handling Testing

#### Test Error Scenarios:
- [‚úÖ] **Invalid URLs**: Try `/schools/invalid-id`, `/programs/invalid-id`
- [‚úÖ] **Unauthorized Access**: Try admin pages without login
- [‚úÖ] **Non-Admin Access**: Try admin pages with regular user
- [‚úÖ] **Invalid CSV**: Upload malformed CSV files

### 8. Mobile Responsiveness Testing

Test on different screen sizes:
- [‚úÖ] **Mobile** (320px-768px): All pages should be mobile-friendly
- [‚úÖ] **Tablet** (768px-1024px): Layout should adapt properly
- [‚úÖ] **Desktop** (1024px+): Full desktop experience

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Supabase client could not be created"
**Solution**: Check your `.env.local` file and restart the dev server

### Issue: Admin pages redirect to login
**Solution**: Ensure your user has `is_admin: true` in the profiles table

### Issue: CSV upload fails
**Solution**: 
- Check network tab for API errors
- Verify CSV format matches expected headers
- Ensure school IDs exist for programs CSV

### Issue: Pages show empty state
**Solution**: Add some test data through admin interface first

## üìä Sample Test Data

Use this sample data to populate your database for testing:

### Schools:
1. **MIT** - Cambridge, MA, USA (QS: 1)
2. **Stanford** - Stanford, CA, USA (QS: 5)
3. **Harvard** - Cambridge, MA, USA (QS: 3)
4. **Oxford** - Oxford, UK (QS: 7)

### Programs (for each school):
1. **Computer Science (MS)** - 24 months, STEM
2. **Business Administration (MBA)** - 24 months, Non-STEM
3. **Data Science (MS)** - 18 months, STEM
